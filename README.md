The report titled "Line Following Robot" explains the design and implementation of a robot that follows a designated path. The robot uses an array of IR sensors to detect lines on a surface (typically a black line on a white surface) and utilizes an Arduino UNO for control. The robot's movement is managed by an H-Bridge Motor Driver (L298N) that controls the DC motors, allowing the robot to turn and follow the line accurately.

The report covers:
- The project’s objective to design a line-following robot.
- Equipment like IR sensors and motor drivers for precise movement.
- The challenges faced during development and how they were addressed.
- The circuit connections and control of the robot’s components, including a detailed schematic.
- Future improvements such as adding obstacle detection, distance sensing, and potential industrial applications for the technology.

The budget information highlights the components used in the project and their costs, totaling 3130 BDT. The future plan includes enhancing the robot’s functionality for industrial use and integrating features like obstacle detection.
